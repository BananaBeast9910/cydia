# The Beast

A Cydia repository based off of the Reposi3 template. The template contains sample on how you can easily make depiction pages without replicating your html pages. The pages are styled using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which is really easy to use. You can see how it looks like by visiting [this sample repo](https://supermamon.github.io/Reposi3/) on your desktop or mobile phone.
